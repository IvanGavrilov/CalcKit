# Introduction

---

One of the main features of **CalcKit** is the built-in [Math Console](https://app.calckit.io/console). Built on top of the extensive [math.js](http://mathjs.org/) library, it can perform any kind of mathematical calculations. Designed for engineers, teachers, students, builders, handymen and more. The results are displayed right below an expression.

You can use hundreds of built-in functions, or you can define your own functions and constants.

CalcKit automatically stores the latest 50 expressions that you type. You can clear the math console by typing the `clear` command.

Within the Math Console you are able to iterate through previous expressions using the `Up` and `Down` keys on your keyboard.

# Import Custom Code

---

CalcKit's Math Console gives you the possibility to import your own functions and constants.

By clicking the **`â‹®`** button and then clicking `Edit Imports` you will access a text-box where you can type your own code that will be automatically imported every time when you open the Math Console.

You can type as many functions/constants/calculations as you want. To separate the expressions you can use semicolon `;` or `new-lines`.

Below is an example of some functions and constants. You can copy-paste the following code in your Math Console and try using some the functions/constants defined in it, to see how it works.

``` Markdown
g = 9.80665 m/s^2;
q = 1.602176620898 * 10^(-19) C;

G = 6.67408 * 10^(-11);
Fg(m1, m2, r) = G * m1 * m2 / r^2;
```
