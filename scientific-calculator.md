# Scientific Calculator

---

One of the main features of **CalcKit** is the built-in [Scientific Calculator](https://app.calckit.io/calculator). Built on top of the extensive [math.js](http://mathjs.org/) library, it is optimized for work, school and any kind of personal calculations. You can do anything from basic to advanced calculations.

Equations in the calculator can be entered using the built-in keyboard or by clicking the equation field and typing the equation manually using your hardware/software keyboard.
