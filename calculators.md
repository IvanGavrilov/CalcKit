# Introduction

---

**Calculators** are the main type of tools within CalcKit. They are very easy to build and represent the largest portion of tools in **CalcKit**

Below I'll try to explain all components of the **calculators** and how to build them, with some examples.

To create a new calculator, open the `My Tools` folder, click the `â‹®` and then click [`Create New Calculator`](https://app.calckit.io/create/converter)

# Components

---

Each calculator is built using multiple required and optional components.

`Icon` `Title` `Category` `Tags` `Header` `Footer` `Image` `Image Description` `Options` `Variables`

The only required components are `Icon`, `Title` and `Variables`.

## Icon / Title / Category / Tags

---

![Icon Title Category Tags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IvanGavrilov/calckit/master/images/icon_title_category_tags.png)

The **Title** and the **Icon** are self-explanatory.

The **Icon** can be changed by simply clicking on it. After you click it, a window will pop-up where you'll see a list with pre-made icons to choose from and also a field where you can type URL to your own icon.

The **Category** could be useful when you add multiple calculators from different branches in the same folder and you want to know to which branche each of them belongs. Take for example our [Library](https://app.calckit.io/library). There are over one-hundred calculators in it, for mathematics, electronics, converters and so on. To find all electronics calculators you would, for example, type `Electronics` in the Search Bar and only the electronics tools will be displayed.

The **Tags** *(separated by space)* are also used for searching, but *(unlike the Title and Category)* they are not visible to the user. Using a correct combination of tags you can create some very nice search queries. For example, in the `Length` converter we have added the units `km` `m` `cm` etc. in the tags and we've also included the word `to`. Now, when you open the [Library](https://app.calckit.io/library) and search for `km to cm` the `Length` converter will be right there on top.

## Header / Footer

---

![Header Footer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IvanGavrilov/calckit/master/images/header_footer.png)

The **Header** is a text box displayed on the top of your calculator, above the image and variables.

The **Footer** is a text box displayed on the bottom of your calculator, below the variables.

Both **Header** and **Footer** are optional fields. If you leave them empty, they will automatically be hidden in your calcualator.

Both fields can contain one or multiple lines of text.

You can also apply some basic styling on the text *(as you can see on the image above)* making portions of it `**bold**`, `//italic//` or `__underlined__`, or also mixing them `**//__together__//**`.

## Image / Image Description

---

![Image Description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IvanGavrilov/calckit/master/images/image_description.png)

CalcKit gives you the possibility to insert an **Image** in your calculator.  
If included, the Image is displayed between the Header and the Variables.

Because we do not host/store user files on our servers, you'll need to upload the **Image** somewhere else ([Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) / [PostImage](https://postimages.org/)) and only type the URL pointing to the image.

As you might know, CalcKit has two themes, light and dark, so if you are using a transparent image, you might want to include two versions of it. You can do that by filling the two fields: `Image URL Dark` for the dark theme and `Image URL Light` for the light theme.

If you fill only one of the URL fields, the same image will be displayed on both themes. If you leave both fields empty, the image box will be automatically hidden in your calculator.

Together with the Image, you can add an **Image Description** as well.

Same as the Header and Footer, the Image Description can have one or multiple lines of text and you can also apply the same text styling that is available for the Header and Footer (`**bold**` `//italic//` `__underlined__`).

*Note: If you do not include an image, the image description will be automatically hidden, regardless of what you have written in it.*

If you include an image, but you leave the image description field empty, the image will take the full width of the page *(see picture right)*. Otherwise, if you write something in the image desciption, the image and it's description will be displayed in the same line, with the image taking around 60% and the description around 40% of the page width *(see picture left)*.

## Variables

---

![Empty Variable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IvanGavrilov/calckit/master/images/empty_variable.png)

Each Variable contains four elements: **Identifier**, **Name**, **Equations** and **Unit(s)**.

All Calculators in CalcKit use a unique Circular Reference Algorithm, which allows each Variable to act as both Input and Output.

#### Identifier

The `Identifier` is basically a unique name/word that you'll use to reference this variable in other variables' equations.

It must begin with a letter `a-z` `A-Z` or underscore `_`.

It can contain letters `a-z` `A-Z`, numbers `0-9` and underscores `_`.

#### Name

The `Name` is a Label for the variable that you see on-screen when you use the Calculator.

#### Equations

Each variable can have any number of equations. It might also have 0 equations in which case the variable is considered to be an input.

In the **Equations** field you an put as many equations as you need to. Each equation needs to put on a new row.

For example, in the [Length Converter](https://app.calckit.io/tool/275d4ed792437a21339c37e9d1dc25a1ebf51265#) you'll find the following equations for the `Meter` variable:
```
_mm * 0.001
_cm * 0.01
_km * 1000
_in * 0.0254
_ft * 0.3048
_mi * 1609.344
```
where `_mm`, `_cm`, `_km`, `_in`, `_ft` and `_mi` are the Identifiers for `Millimeter`, `Centimeter`, `Kilometer`, `Feet` and `Mile` respectively.

#### Unit(s)
