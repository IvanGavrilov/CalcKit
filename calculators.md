# Introduction

---

**Calculators** are the main type of tools within CalcKit. They are very easy to build and represent the largest portion of tools in **CalcKit**

Below I'll try to explain all components of the **calculators** and how to build them, with some examples.

To create a new calculator, open the `My Tools` folder, click the `â‹®` and then click [`Create New Calculator`](https://app.calckit.io/create/converter)

# Components

---

Each calculator is built using multiple required and optional components:

Required: `Icon` `Title` `Variables`

Optional: `Category` `Header` `Footer` `Image` `Image Description` `Options`

---

### Icon and Title

**Icon** and **Title** for the Converter.

The **Icon** can be changed by simply clicking on it. After you click it, a window will show up where you'll see a list with pre-made icons to choose from and also a field where you can type URL to your own icon.
